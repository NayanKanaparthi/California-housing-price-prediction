# Irish Song Poetry Generation Model

Welcome to the Irish Song Poetry Generation Model! This open-source project aims to train a model that can learn from a collection of Irish songs and generate poetic lyrics inspired by the rich cultural heritage of Ireland. The goal is to create a tool that can generate original and captivating poetry, capturing the essence of Irish music and storytelling.

## Model Overview

The Irish Song Poetry Generation Model is built using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning framework. We utilize various components from the TensorFlow library to construct a deep learning model capable of generating Irish song poetry.

The model architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Embedding Layer**: This layer converts text input into dense numerical vectors, representing the semantic meaning of each word or sequence of words. It helps the model understand the contextual relationships between different words in the Irish songs.

2. **Bidirectional LSTM Layer**: LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequences. The bidirectional nature of the LSTM allows the model to consider both past and future contexts when generating poetry, enhancing its ability to create coherent and meaningful lyrics.

3. **Dense Layer**: The dense layer is responsible for the final prediction in the model. It maps the hidden representations from the LSTM layer to the appropriate output format, generating the poetic lyrics based on the learned patterns and structures.

4. **Tokenizer**: We use the Tokenizer from TensorFlow to preprocess the input text, converting it into numerical representations that the model can understand. This step involves tokenizing the text into individual words, assigning unique numerical IDs to each word, and transforming the text into sequences of these numerical IDs.

5. **Adam Optimizer**: The model utilizes the Adam optimizer, a popular optimization algorithm, to adjust the model's internal parameters during the training process. This optimizer helps the model converge to better solutions and improve the quality of the generated poetry.
